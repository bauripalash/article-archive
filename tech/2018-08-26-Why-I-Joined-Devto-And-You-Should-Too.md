# Why I Joined DevTo Community And You Should Too

I knew about Dev.to for a long time, even I read some articles there, but I didn't Signup there. I was not at all convinced to join till 16th August.

On 16th August morning, I was looking into GitHub Trending projects, and on the top, I found this.

Dev.to became Open Source! **Open Source** is like a loved word to me; I immediately went straight to dev.to and signed up.

I started surfing through lots of articles. I liked them so much. Then I posted some of my articles from [Adventure of Palash](https://palash.tk) there, and surprisingly, I got very good responses even daily traffic on [Adventure of Palash](https://palash.tk) got boosted. 

And you won't believe within few days **I crossed 200+ followers** and now heading to 300.

#### One thing I liked most is the friendly folks. People on dev.to are very friendly.

Within a few days, I started using dev.to very much. It is like a kind of home to me. It is like **Facebook for Developers**

I even learned (and still learning) lots of things from there, such as **mistakes** I make while writing articles for my blog and about some new technologies, new concepts, new programming languages, and much more.

If I talk about the User Interface, it's fabulous simple, but powerful. Easy use and free from bloating unwanted widgets. I like it very much!

Another good thing is you don't need to install a bloated mobile app to use it properly on Android or iOS devices. It is quite simple to add it's PWA to home screen without needing to install something.

From the first day, I read new articles every day and learn something new every time. 

You can see it's in the third position on my frequently used apps.

One Thing I mentioned Earlier, Dev.to open source and its Source Code is available on GitHub. If you found something wrong, you can create an issue there. If you want a feature very badly, you can let the Developers know via an issue. You can also contribute to the codebase to make it better.


### Recommendation
