The results for the West Bengal Board (India) Madhyamik 2018 have been published. As always, those results bring happiness 😀 to some, and sadness & _heartbreak_ 😭 for others.

When the results were declared on the news channels this morning at 9 o'clock, I was eager to hear from those students that managed to make the list.
All of them were asked about their life-style during pre-examination time, how they studied and what their future plan were after now.

There was however something very peculiar about their answer:
**Most of the students wanted to be a _Doctor_** 

I'm not saying that that's bad but I am somewhat surprised that nobody said that they want to do something for our country or people who need help.

That's really sad! 😯
