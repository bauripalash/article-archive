West Bengal Board (India) Madhyamik Results of 2018 has been declared. Results always brings happiness ðŸ˜€ for few and sadness & _heartbreak_ ðŸ˜­ for few.

![Sad](https://media1.tenor.com/images/44396a8da3c65f507608a970581fbc94/tenor.gif?itemid=3518791)

Today At 9 O'clock in the morning, when the result was declared, News Channels, as always, we're eager to get comments of Students Who are in Merit List.

All of the students were asked about their lifestyle during pre-examination time, how they studied, and their target after now.

I found something interesting in their question.
**Most of the students wanted to be a _Doctor_** 

I'm not saying that that's bad, but I'm surprised that nobody said that they want to do something for our country or people who need help.

That's Really Sad! ðŸ˜¯
