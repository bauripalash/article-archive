The West Bengal Madhyamik Result 2018 has been declared. Results bring happiness ðŸ˜€ for a few but sadness & _heartbreak_ ðŸ˜­ for others.

Today, at 9' in the morning, the result was shown in News Channels, also showing comments from students who are in the Merit List.

All of the students were asked about their life style pre-examination, how they studied, and what their target is for the future.

I found something interesting in their answers.
**Most of the students wanted to be _Doctors_** 

I'm not saying that it's bad, but I'm surprised that nobody wanted to do something for our country or for people who need help.

It's Really Sad! ðŸ˜¯
