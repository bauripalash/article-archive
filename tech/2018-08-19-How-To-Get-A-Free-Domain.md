# How to Get Your Own Free Domain

In the **era of internet**, everyone wants their online presence, but having an online presence is not so simple as it seems. To have your own website, you should have a domain name otherwise it would be like yourname.blogspot.com or yourname.wordpress.com

Domain names such as .com , .me , .io , .org are not free, they usually have a huge price range, which might not be affordable for you. So today, I'm going to share some services which provide free domain names.

But always remember in this world everything costs so if you're getting a free domain you should use it only for testing because free domains have so many disadvantages. I would recommend getting a paid domain from services such as Namecheap spending few bucks.

> Some people claimed that freedom took their domain and demanded money , I don't think that's true because as you can see this blog is even using .tk domain (okay, okay, I used .tk as an experiment that google indexes all sites which got some pretty impressive contents, no matter which domain you're using)
