### Meaning Of Name Kailash

The word **Kailash** was probably derived from the Sanskrit word  “kelāsa” (केलास), which means "crystal."

The Tibetan name for the mountain is Gangs Rin-po-che, Gangs or Kang is the Tibetan word for snow peak analogous to alp or hima; rinpoche is an honorific meaning "precious one" so the combined term can be translated "precious jewel of snows."

### Mystery Begins

Mount Kailash might seem a normal mountain, but which makes it mysterious is that till date, nobody successfully climbed up to the top.

> According to some Russian Mountain Experts, Mount Kailash is there like an axis. 

Some Even Claim that it was built by aliens, and it's a pyramid.

There's a folklore in Tibet that Yogi Milarepa climbed to the top of Mount Kailash and upon returning he warned everyone never to visit it again, he said,  <q>Only A Person Who Has No Skin on Body Can Reach The Top Of Kailash</q>

According to Some modern climbers, 
"Kailash is Utterly Unclimbable"

### Attempts Of Climbing


In 1926, Hugh Ruttledge studied the north face, which he estimated was 6,000 ft (1,800 m) high and "utterly unclimbable" and thought about an ascent of the northeast ridge, but he ran out of time. Ruttledge had been exploring the area with Colonel R. C. Wilson, who was on the other side of the mountain with his Sherpa named Tseten. According to Wilson, Tseten told Wilson, "'Sahib, we can climb that!' ... as he too saw that this [the SE ridge] represented a feasible route to the summit." Further excerpts from Wilson's article in the Alpine Journal (vol. 40, 1928) show that he was serious about climbing Kailash, but he also ran out of time. 

Herbert Tichy, another climber, in 1936, attempting to climb Gurla Mandhata. When he asked one of the Garpons of Ngari whether Kailash was climbable, the Garpon replied, "Only a man entirely free of sin could climb Kailash. And he wouldn't have actually to scale the sheer walls of ice to do it – he'd just turn himself into a bird and fly to the summit."

### Mystery Continues

Some Climbers who tried Climbing Kailash claimed there's no magnetic field. As a result, the compass doesn't work there.
According to some local folklore, aging factor speeds up in Kailash, Nails, and Hair grows too fast there. Some even claim that if somebody spends 12 hours in Kailash aging process speeds up to twice.

But still, there're no scientific explanation or proof about it.

### Connection to Ramayana

Kailash is located near Lake [Manasarovar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Manasarovar) and [Lake Rakshastal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Rakshastal).
Lake Mansarovar and Lake Rakshastal are not far from each other, but Still, water of Lale Manasarovar is drinkable, but water of Rakshastal is salty and not drinkable.

According to [Ramayana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana), [Ravana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravana) the king of Lanka was a worshiper of Lord Shiva, and to wanted to take Kailash to Lanka by pulling the whole mountain but failed, that's why some cracks can be seen in Mount Kailash and the Lake Rakshastal was created with the sweat of Ravana.
