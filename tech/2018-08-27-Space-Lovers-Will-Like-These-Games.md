#  If You're A Space Lover You'll Like These Games

Space is full of Mystery, when we look at the night we see millions of stars. I know many of you want to visit space but that's upon your dedication and a little of fate. But in meanwhile we can enjoy the space with these games.

Humans are born curious, we want to see things with our own eye, touch with our own hands, hear with our own ears. Space is a place where humans couldn't dominate by now so many of us do fascinate about space, stars, planets... But visiting space isn't a child's play, it requires so much money, time and even skills.

But I found a way to quench your thirst of space adventure, some awesome people have developed some games which can give us a little pleasure of space adventure (It's better to have something rather than having nothing ðŸ˜‰). If you have an Android device, you can enjoy all the games for free and have a little space adventure (kind of).

So without further talking let's start...

## â€¢ Spaceflight Simulator

It's a game about adventure and crafting. You can build your own rockets and explore the space. 

Anything you see there can be visited, there are no limits if you want you can even land on the sun!

With this, you get your own **pocket universe **, just build and let fly!

## â€¢ Space Frontier & Space Frontier 2

Usually, I don't spend too much time on playing games, but these two games especially **Space Frontier** is just awesome that I can't even resist not to play too much.

When playing this game, my reaction is kinda like, "Yeah, I'm Elon Musk, Ha Ha, I'm colonizing Mars, Ha Ha, Look At Me " ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

## â€¢ Space Agency

This is free and easy to run your own Virtual space program. You can build rockets, launch them, build a space stations, launch satellites and also explore the solar system.

Though it might be complex and challenging for some still it's a very enjoyable game.

I played this game for a few weeks and really liked it. You should give it a try.
