**The Reason we Code is to solve Problems**

[Programming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming) is not all about Mathematics, it's about solving problems we face in our daily life, and doing so we sometimes need Mathematics.

So let's do some simple Mathematics with [Python](https://python.org), we've chosen Python because it's easy to learn and has a clear syntax.

> I recommend reading my previous article about starting with python <https://palash.tk/Simple-Introduction-To-Python-Programming>, read that before going further if you're new to Programming or Python

So let's start..

## Start Python

If you've python installed locally run [IDLE](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE) otherwise use online interpreter like [Repl.It](https://repl.it/languages/python3)

If You've Opened IDLE or Other [REPL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop) you'll see a prompt like this,

`>>>`

If you're using  [Repl.It](https://repl.it/languages/python3), on the right pan you'll also see a prompt like 

`>`

If you find any problems please comment below the article, I'll surely help you!

## Simple Calculations With Python 👀

If you've successfully completed the previous chapter, now you have a `>>>`  or `>` prompt on your screen.

In the `>>>` type `1+2` and press enter. If you've done everything correctly you'll see a output of `3`

Try other,

- Addition ,
    `>>> 1 + 30 + 2`
    You'll get 33 


- Subtraction,
    `>>> 9-8`
    You'll get 1


- Multiplication ,
    `>>> 9 * 11`
    You'll get 99


- Division ,
    `>>> 444/2`
    You'll get 222.0

### Let's Do a Complex Calculation ✊

`(123456789 + 987654321) * 8`
