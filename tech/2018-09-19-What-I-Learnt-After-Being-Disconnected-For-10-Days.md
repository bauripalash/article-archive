# What I Learnt After Being Disconnected For 10 Days

I was that kind of guy who uses lots of internets (Actually Too Much..) but unfortunately my phone's charging port got damaged so I had no way left other than sending it to Service Center. The guy there told me it's gonna take a while.

> ### I knew for these days I'll not be able to use the internet so I'll not able to upload any articles.

Actually I use the internet on my pc via USB Tethering from my phone, so there was no chance of uploading new content.

> ### I learned a few things these days.

I was disconnected, left with an old keypad phone. Actually it helped to get rid of the overuse of the internet and concentrate more on my studies. I started visiting nearby places more often.  I started hanging out with my friends with phone calls rather than texting.

I usually spend most of time building. But as the internet was gone I was creating designs of my inventions by hand with a pen and pencil. 

As my resources were limited, I was kinda lost for the first few days but then after things got better.

Inventor Palash Bauri returned, I built some new gadgets. I read more books.

> ### Something inside me was changed. My Inventor self was in the front again.

I think, Everybody who uses the internet a lot should take a break and enjoy the surroundings. Just try it once!ðŸ˜‰
