# What I Learnt After Being Disconnected For 10 Days

I was the kind of guy who uses the internet a lot (too much actually :P ..), unfortunately my phone's charging port got damaged and I had no choice but to send it to the Service Center. The guy there told me it would take a while.

> ### I knew I wouldn't be able to use the internet for the following few days, and hence, would also not be able to upload any articles.

Actually, I use internet on my pc by USB Tethering my phone, so there was no chance of uploading new content.

> ### I learnt a few things these days.

I was disconnected, left with an old keypad phone. Actually it helped to get rid of the overuse of internet and concentrate more on my studies. I started visiting nearby places more often.  I started hanging out with my friends and also converse through phone calls rather than texting.

I usually spend most of time creating and designing. But as I was offline, I was creating designs of my inventions by hand with pen and pencil. 

As my resources were limited, I was kinda lost for the first few days, but then things got better.

Inventor Palash Bauri returned, I built some new gadgets, I read more books.

> ### Something inside me changed. My Inventor self was in front again.

I believe that everybody who uses the internet a lot should take a break and enjoy their surroundings. Just Try it once!ðŸ˜‰
