### •  Step 1: Selecting Emoji

Choose your favorite emoji which you want in your domain name, such as 🌐, ❤, 🌳, ☕, etc.

If you're on Desktop or on Mobile, which doesn't have an Emoji keyboard, don't worry, I have a solution for you.
Use <https://emojipedia.org>. They have all the emojis listed, just search in the search box which emoji you want.

If you have selected your domain name, proceed to the next step.

### • Step 2: Converting into Punycode

Domain registrars don't support emoji input, so you have to convert your selected emoji [Punycode](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode) which is their Latin representation.

You Can Use <http://punycoder.com/> to convert emoji to Punycode. 

Copy the emoji from [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org), or type in directly from keyboard then click on **Convert To Punycode >>** button and copy the output from below box.

#### • [Alternative Way]

You can also use Chrome or Other Web Browser to get Punycode, just do this.

At the address bar of web browser, type your emoji then **.abc **, without any space

> **.abc** is not mandatory i just put it for example you can use any other TLDs such as **.com** , **.xyz** etc.

Then Your Browser will automatically convert the emoji to Punycode,

If you entered something like, 🌐.abc it will be converted to **xn--wg8h.abc* **,s o copy your Punycode which is here **xn--wg8h**

### • Step 3: Register The Domain

As we want the domain for free, we will be using <https://freenom.com>, Signup there and in search domain box paste our Punycode and hit enter if your domain is available it will be listed below, if not you've to choose another emoji domain and convert it to Punycode using previous steps.

If available, register your domain for free no credit card will be required. Then using domain panel, you can forward the domain to your existing website or set up a brand new website with your brand new Emoji Domain.

> Important Note: as Freenom is a free domain registrar, don't expect too much. If you want a professional emoji domain go for **.ws** domain, most of people who has emoji domain using this TLD.

**Enjoy Your Brand New Emoji Domain 😉👍**
