**Science** , You've heard the word many times. Nowadays in developing countries like India, Science is one of key things to run a country.

Science is one of the most common thing in our life that we encounter everyday, from Bedroom to Drawing Room , Bathroom to Kitchen, Office , College... Simply Everywhere. 

But the sad truth is , **Many Students Are Afraid of Studying Science**, they say _Science is Hard_ , _Science is only for Meritorious Students_ , _I'm not capable of Science_ and so on..

Science is not hard , it depends on how you're taught.  Science is easy , it just needs a great teacher to show you the enjoying path of learning Science.

Just Think , How Can a Thing Which We Use Daily cannot be learnt by YOU.

So my fellow readers, there's a saying,

> A Good Student is Also a Good Teacher

So , if you're from Science Stream, Show Others the fun way to learn Science, Because Fate of Humanity is in your hand now...😊
