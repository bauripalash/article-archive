**Science **, You've heard the word many times. Nowadays, in developing countries like India, Science is one of the key things to run a country.

Science is one of the most common things in our life that we encounter every day, from Bedroom to Drawing Room, Bathroom to Kitchen, Office, College... Simply Everywhere. 

But the sad truth is, **Many Students Are Afraid of Studying Science**, they say _Science is Hard _, _Science is only for Meritorious Students _, _I'm not capable of Science_ and so on.

Science is not hard. It depends on how you're taught.  Science is easy. It just needs a great teacher to show you the enjoying path of learning Science.

Just Think, How can a Thing Which We Use you can not learn daily.

So, my fellow readers, there's a saying,

> A Good Student is Also a Good Teacher

So, if you're from Science Stream, Show Others the fun way to learn Science, Because Fate of Humanity is in your hand now...ðŸ˜Š
