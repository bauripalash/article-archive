Python is a programming language that is **Easy to learn** ,  has **Clear Syntax**. I recommend every newcomer to learn Python first because,

- Easy to learn
- Used by Major Tech Giants
- Used in from Simple Desktop to NASA research centre
- Salary of Python Programmers is very high

Let's Learn Something without further talking,

##  Let's start with Traditional Hello World


**Hello World** is a traditional program that every programmer writes at very first time when learning a new Programming Language, in python it's very simple:

{% highlight python %}

print("Hello World")

{% endhighlight %}


In This Current Moment you might be wondering how can you write python programs yourself?

Actually There're two ways to do it

1. **Online, in a online interpreter**
2. **Offline,  in your local computer**

### 1. Write and Run Python Programs Online

There're plenty of ways to write and run Python Programs online , but my recommendation is **repl.it**

Step 1 : goto <https://repl.it/languages/python3>

Step 2 :  On the left side write python programs (eg. Hello World program above) , and click "Run >" 

Step 3 :  Now on The console at right side you'll see output `Hello World`

You can also Signup there to save your programs for later use.


### 2. Write and Run Python Programs On Your Local Computer

Step 1 : Download Python for you Windows or Mac Computer from <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
(Choose Python Version 3.6 or above)

Step 2 : Install and Read The Guide which explains how to install and use Python <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>

After You Run The **Hello World** Program,
Welcome To The World Of Programming.

####  ❤ You're now a Python Programmer 😎
