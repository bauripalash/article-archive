Python is a programming language that is **Easy to learn** and has **Clear Syntax**. I recommend every newcomer to learn Python first because...

- it's easy to learn.
- it's used by Major Tech Giants.
- it's used in a wide range of products, from Simple Desktop to NASA research centres.
- the salary of Python Programmers is very high.

Now, without further ado, let's learn something:

##  Let's start with traditional Hello World


**Hello World** is a traditional program that every programmer writes at first when learning a new programming language. In python it's very simple:

{% highlight python %}

print("Hello World")

{% endhighlight %}


In this current moment you might be wondering how you can write python programs yourself?

Actually there're two ways to do it:

1. **Online, in a online interpreter**
2. **Offline,  in your local computer**

### 1. Write and run python programs online

There're plenty of ways to write and run Python Programs online, but my recommendation is **repl.it**

Step 1 : goto <https://repl.it/languages/python3>

Step 2 :  You can write your python programs (eg. Hello World program above) on the left side in main.py

Step 3:  Click "Run >" to compile

Step 4 :  Now you'll see the output (eg. `Hello World`) on the right side in the console

You can also sign up there to save your programs for later use.


### 2. Write and run Python programs on your local computer

Step 1 : Download Python for your Windows or Mac computer from <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
(Choose Python Version 3.6 or above)

Step 2 : Read the guide which explains how to install and use Python <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>

Step 3 : Now you can install it and run your first Python program

After running the **Hello World** program, 
welcome to the world of programming.

####  ❤ You're now a Python programmer 😎
