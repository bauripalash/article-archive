Python is a programming language that is **Easy to learn**, and has **Clear Syntax**. I recommend every newcomer to learn Python first because:

- It's easy to learn.
- It's used by Major Tech Giants.
- It's used in projects ranging from simple, to ultra-complex.
- the salary of Python programmers is very high.

Let's learn some Python!

## Let's start with the Traditional "Hello World"


**Hello World** is typically the first programmer every programmer writes when learning a new language.
It's very simple in Python.

```python
print("Hello World")
```

At this moment you might be wondering; how can you write python programs yourself?

Actually there're two ways to do it.

1. **Online, in a online interpreter**
2. **Offline, in your local computer**

### 1. Write and Run Python Programs Online

There're plenty of ways to write and run Python Programs online, but my recommendation is **repl.it**

Step 1 : Go to <https://repl.it/languages/python3>

Step 2 :  On the left side write python programs (eg. Hello World program above) , and click "Run >" 

Step 3 :  Now on the console on the right side, you'll see the output `Hello World`

You can also Sign-up to save your programs for later use.


### 2. Write and Run Python Programs On Your Local Computer

Step 1 : Download Python for you Windows or Mac Computer from <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
(Choose Python Version 3.6 or above)

Step 2 : install and Read The Guide which explains how to install and use Python <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>

After running the **Hello World** program, you can call yourself a programmer.
Welcome to the World of Programming.
