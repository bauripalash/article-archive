Python is a programming language that is **Easy to learn**,and has **Clear Syntax**.
I recommend newcomers to learn Python for the following reasons :
- Easy to learn
- Used by major tech giants
- Used in simple desktops, to NASA research centres
- Salary of a Python programmer is very high

Without further ado, let's now learn some basic Python.

##  Let's start with the traditional 'Hello World'


**Hello World** is a traditional program that every programmer writes for the first time when learning a new programming language. In Python, it's simple:

{% highlight python %}

print("Hello World")

{% endhighlight %}


Now you might be wondering how to write Python programs yourself?

There are two ways to do it,

1. **Online, in an online interpreter**
2. **Offline, in your local computer**

### 1. Write and Run Python Programs Online

There are plenty of ways to write and run Python programs online, but my recommendation is **repl.it**

Step 1 : Go to <https://repl.it/languages/python3>

Step 2 :  On the left side write Python programs (like the 'Hello World' program given above), and click "Run >" 

Step 3 :  You'll see the output `Hello World` on the console which will appear to the right

You can also signup to save your programs for later use.


### 2. Write and Run Python Programs On Your Local Computer

Step 1 : Download Python for Windows or Mac from <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
(Choose Python Version 3.6 or above)

Step 2 : Install and read the guide which explains the installation procedure and how to use Python. <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>

Assuming that you have run The **Hello World** program successfully, I welcome you to the world of Programming.
