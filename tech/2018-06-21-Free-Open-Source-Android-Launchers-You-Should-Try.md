If you're an Android Phone User, there's 99% probability that you've heard about **Android Launchers **, if you haven't,

> Android launchers are apps that can spice up your phone's home screen or act as a personal assistant. They help you to customize your android phone

Android Launchers are usually used by people who don't want to be limited by system provided **User Interface**

Today We'll Take a Look at two of my favorite **Free & Open Source**  Android Launcher.

Let's Start...


##  Lawnchair Launcher

It's an Open Source Android Launcher, available on Play Store as well as F-Droid.

It's Customisable, Fast, Lightweight, Easy To Use.


There's plenty of Customizing Settings available.

One thing I like most about it is its speed and minimalist design.


I'm not telling you to use them, but I recommend you to try them once.

Now It depends on what you want, whether it might be minimalist design or lightweight design or feature-rich style.


You'll hear people talking about Nova Launcher or Apex Launcher. I'm not saying that they are bad, but they are feature-rich, and they drain too much battery.

So Next Time Choosing Launcher Choose Carefully. ðŸ˜‰
