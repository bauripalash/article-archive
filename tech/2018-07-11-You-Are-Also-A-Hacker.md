Most of people in developing countries like India thinks Hacking is Always Illegal and Hackers Are always Criminals, in my personal experience I got many requests from my friends and family members to hack someone's Facebook Account, Someone's Instagram account and so on. I became tired telling the difference between an [Ethical Hacker/White Hat Hacker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)) and a [Black Hat Hacker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat). 


> When I tell people I'm an Ethical Hacker, they say _"What's The Difference , Hackers are Always Bad Guys"_

## Let's Play A Simple Game

> Let's make a paper airplane and I'll tell you how you're also a hacker (but not a bad hacker).

#### Make a Paper Airplane

#### Let's Look Into The *Definition* of Hacking,

> Computer Hacker : A [computer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem. While "hacker" can refer to any skilled computer [programmer](#)

**In my words, A Hacker is a person who studies a system , understand how it works and modify it to work such works that it was not meant for.**

## So, How You Are a Hacker?

**When you built the above mentioned paper airplane, you also became a hacker.**

Because, the paper/newspaper you used to build the airplane was not meant to be used as a paper airplane it was created with a purpose of writing & reading but you *Hacked* it.

So Now , You've Became a Hacker but not a Criminal.

In our daily life we often do such things which makes us hacker but we've to understand every hacker is not criminal. 

If all Hackers were criminal , you would be in jail now because **You Are Also a Hacker**
