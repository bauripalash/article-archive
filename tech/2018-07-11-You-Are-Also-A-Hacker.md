Most of people in developing countries like India thinks Hacking is Always Illegal and Hackers Are always Criminals, in my personal experience I got many requests from my friends and family members to hack someone's Facebook Account, Someone's Instagram account and so on. I became tired telling the difference between an [Ethical Hacker/White Hat Hacker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_(computer_security)) and a [Black Hat Hacker](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat). 


> When I tell people I'm an Ethical Hacker, they say _"What's The Difference , Hackers are Always Bad Guys"_

## Let's Play A Simple Game

> Let's make a paper airplane and I'll tell you how you're also a hacker (but not a bad hacker).

#### Make a Paper Airplane

Follow The Following Instructions To Build a Paper Airplane, I hope it will only take less than two minutes to complete.

#### Let's Look Into The *Definition* of Hacking,

> Computer Hacker: AÂ [computer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) hackerÂ is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem. While "hacker" can refer to any skilled computerÂ [programmer](#)

**In my words, A Hacker is a person who studies a system, understand how it works and modify it to work such works that it was not meant for.**

## So, How You Are a Hacker?

**When you built the above-mentioned paper airplane, you also became a hacker.**

Because the paper/newspaper you used to build the airplane was not meant to be used as a paper airplane, it was created with a purpose of writing & reading, but you *Hacked* it.

So now, You've Became a Hacker but not a Criminal.

In our daily life, we often do such things which makes us hacker, but we've to understand every hacker is not criminal. 

If all Hackers were criminal, you would be in jail now because **You Are Also a Hacker**
