# Building a Simple URL Shortener With Just HTML and Javascript

URL Shortener, you might have used one of them in your life, such as [bit.ly](https://bit.ly), [goo.gl](https://goo.gl), and much more. They are useful for shortening long URLs so that you can easily share them with your friends, family, or co-workers. 

You might be wondering how these things work? To understand how these things work, we need to take a closer look at an URL shortener, so we’ll be building a simple URL shortener. With That Task, we’ll be learning some new things as well as understand how URL Shortener works.


Today, we'll be building a simple URL shortener which does not need a database system to host yourself. Instead, we'll use [jsonstore.io](https://jsonstore.io), I'll be assuming that you already know some basic HTML & Javascript. 

So without further talking, Let's Start Building. . .

## Start with HTML Part : 

we'll need only a text input box, a button, and a script tag to create our URL shortener.

first create an HTML file called `index.html`, as there is only a need of two elements, a text input box, a button.

So Let's start adding our three main elements,

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <input type="url" id="urlinput">
        <button onclick="shorturl()">Short The URL</button>
        <script src="main.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

As I have shown in the above code, I've created a simple HTML file. Inside body tags, there're only three elements an `input`, a `button`, and a `script.`

the first element is `input` where we will type/paste our long URL, I gave it an id name `URL input` so it would be easy to access it inside javascript.

The next element is a `button,` when we click this button, our long URL will be shortened as it has `onclick` function which will be executed when we click the button, inside the `shorturl()` function there will be commands necessary to shorten the URL.

At the end, we have a `script` called `main.js` where all our main javascript codes will be in, above mentioned `shorturl()` function will also be there.

So, for now, our HTML part is complete. so let's start writing some javascript


## Start writing some Javascript :

As we have shown above, we'll need some javascript to create our URL shortener.

**Step 0:** as I mentioned at first we'll be using **jsonstore.io** to store information about our long URL, we will need a **jsonstore.io** **endpoint** URL to store data, Visit [jsonstore.io](https://jsonstore.io), you'll see something like below

![Jsonstore Screenshot](https://palash.tk/assets/images/jsonstore_sshot.png)

Under the text _This Is Your Endpoint_ you can see a text box with long URL such as,

```javascript
https://www.jsonstore.io/8ba4fd855086288421f770482e372ccb5a05d906269a34da5884f39eed0418a1
```

Click the purple *COPY* button.

So now, let's start writing some javascript . . .

create a javascript file called `main.js` and start following below steps

first, we must keep the copied link a variable

```javascript
var endpoint = "https://www.jsonstore.io/8ba4fd855086288421f770482e372ccb5a05d906269a34da5884f39eed0418a1";
```

then we need to generate some random string so that we can create a link between the short URL and the long URL.

> Assume, we have a random URL `and`, our simple URL shortener is hosted on <https://shortner.com> and we have shortened the URL <https://google.com> with that random URL, so whenever we go to <https://shortner.com/#abcd> we will be redirected to <https://google.com>

So, now well create a function called `getrandom()`

```javascript
function getrandom(){
    var random_string = Math.random().toString(32).substring(2, 5) + Math.random().toString(32).substring(2, 5);
    return random_string()
}
```

Don't worry, I'll help you understand the above code, 

first, we initiated a function called `getrandom` than we initialized a variable called `random_string` and gave it a value.

Math is a built-in javascript object which allows us to perform mathematical tasks on numbers. first we called the `random` function from `Math` , `Math.random()` returns a random number between 0 (inclusive),  and 1  (exclusive)

> You Can Learn More About `Math` object from [HERE](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp) 

Then we transform the returned number to a string using `toString()` and we gave it an argument of 32 so that we get a proper string not a binary, hexadecimal or octal, 

Then we use `substring(2,5)` as well to slice the string and maintain the size of the string, then again we follow the same procedure to get another chunk of a random string and finally we add both chunks of the string using `+` 

and don't forget to add a `return` statement returning our random string.

> Remember, this is not the only way to generate random strings you can also use the technic mentioned below to achieve the goal

```

function getrandom() {
    var text = "";
    var possible = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789";

    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        text += possible.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * possible.length));
    return text;
}

```


Now Return to `index.html` and add JQuery because it will be easy to achieve our goals with ease if we use JQuery.

add `<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>` at the end of body tag but before the `main.js` script tag

now again return to `main.js`

let's Create a Function called `geturl` which will take the value from the input box verify it and return the value

```javascript

function geturl(){
    var url = document.getElementById("urlinput").value;
    var protocol_ok = url.startsWith("http://") || url.startsWith("https://") || url.startsWith("ftp://");
    if(!protocol_ok){
        newurl = "http://"+url;
        return newurl;
        }else{
            return url;
        }
}
```

in `geturl` function we first store the value of the input box in `URL` variable. Then we check if URL protocols are ok or not and if the protocol doesn't start with `http://` , `https://` or `ftp://` we add `http://` at the beginning of the URL then return the URL.

Now we will need another function to change the hash in the location bar, let's create

```javascript
function genhash(){
    if (window.location.hash == ""){
        window.location.hash = getrandom();
    }
}
```

At first, we check if the hash location is empty if it's empty we than add a random hash to the location bar.

> Example: if our URL is <https://example.com/#abcd> then the value of `window.location.hash` will be `#abcd`


Next, we'll work on our main function `shorturl()` , so let's go...

```javascript
function shorturl(){
    var longurl = geturl();
    genhash();
    send_request(longurl);
}
```

At first we store the long URL in `longurl` variable then we add a random hash to the location bar so that we can use the URL as the short url , then we call the `send_request()` with an argument  `longurl` , in this function we send JSON request to **jsonstore** to store the long URL with a link to short URL , so now let's create the `send_request()` function.

```javascript

function send_request(url) {
    this.url = url;
    $.ajax({
        'url': endpoint + "/" + window.location.hash.substr(1),
        'type': 'POST',
        'data': JSON.stringify(this.url),
        'dataType': 'json',
        'contentType': 'application/json; charset=utf-8'
})
}
```

Here we use JQuery to send JSON request. We send the request to **endpoint+"/" + our random string hash from the location bar**
as an example, 

```javascript
https://www.jsonstore.io/8ba4fd855086288421f770482e372ccb5a05d906269a34da5884f39eed0418a1/abcd

```

so whenever we send a get request to the above-mentioned URL, we'll get the long URL as `data` 

**Important** : add the `send_request()` function before the `shorturl()` function ,  otherwise it will not work

> To Know More About JQuery's Ajax Function go [HERE](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ajax_ajax.asp)
To Know More About JSON, go [HERE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)

now we will see the code to GET the long URL linked to the short URL entered in the address bar

```javascript
var hashh = window.location.hash.substr(1)

if (window.location.hash != "") {
    $.getJSON(endpoint + "/" + hashh, function (data) {
        data = data["result"];

        if (data != null) {
            window.location.href = data;
        }

    });
}
```

then the above-mentioned code will be executed whenever we put the short URL in the address bar (e.g., <https://shorturl.com/#abcd> )

at first, we store the hash value from the URL to the `hashh` variable.

> Example: if our short URL is https://shorted.com/#abcd , the value of hash will be **#abcd**

then we check if the hash location is empty or not, if not empty we send a get request to the address, `endpoint` + `hashh`

> Example : 
```javascript
https://www.jsonstore.io/8ba4fd855086288421f770482e372ccb5a05d906269a34da5884f39eed0418a1/abcd
```

And as usual, if everything is okay, we will get the long URL from the data, which is a JSON array data. From that, we extract the result with `data["result"]`.

> value of data will be similar to this `{"result":longurl, "ok": true},` where long URL is the URL you shortened

Our URL Shortener is Almost Complete! Copy-Paste a long URL in the input box then click **Short The URL** button! Copy The Link from Address Bar. It's your short URL!

## Some Useful Tricks

We can add a function to automatically copy the short URL when a user clicked the **Short The URL** button Using libraries like [SimpleCopy](https://github.com/kyle-rb/simplecopy), or [ClipboardJS](https://clipboardjs.com/) to copy the short URL which is currently in the location bar.

if using SimpleCopy We can add `simplecopy(window.location.href);` at the end of `shorturl()` function copy the short url whenever use shortens a url

This Simple Url shortener relies on third-party libs such as **jsonstore**, so it would not be a good idea to shorten some confidential long URL with it.

You can host the Whole Project in Github/Gitlab pages and set up a simple CNAME, that's it your brand new personal URL shortener is ready, you can use any static site hosting service to host your URL shortener.
