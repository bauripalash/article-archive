If you're reading this there're chances that you're interested in learning Python or already a Python Programmer who loves to experiment, if yes, **Welcome My Friend To The World of Curiosity**. If you're an Android device and you want to run python programs on your device this article is for you.



> [Android](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) is based on [Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux) [Kernel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)) so it's 100% possible to run python. 

There are plenty of way ways to run python Programs in Android, we'll discuss a few of them here. So let's start our journey.



## #1 QPython

When it comes to run Python Programs, Scripts on Android, first name came to my mind is **QPython** developed by China, Beijing based **QPythonLab**

It has so many features that you'll love it. It has **Terminal emulator **, Python REPL, **Powerful Editor**,  Many python libraries, **Run scripts via QR code **, **PIP **, courses and much more.

But it's a drawback is when you install it first from Play Store it comes with Python 2, you've to install Python3 plugin to use Python 3.

Download App From : [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.qpython.qpy)




## #2 PyDroid 3

**PyDroid** is a less known python IDE for Android and is also *My Favourite *. I like it because of its simplicity, extra features that QPython fails to provide. With PyDroid you can even create GUIs, games and much more. PyDroid is developed by Russia bases IIEC

It's specially designed for educational purposes. Most popular Machine Learning and Data Science python libraries are available, making it ideal for  testing and experimenting *On-The-Go*

## #3 Termux

the name suggests it's a [terminal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal) emulator for Android so as usual, you can use it's package manager `pkg` or `apt` to install python.

Install Termux from : [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux)

To Install Python 3 on Termux type this in Termux :

`pkg install python`

`pkg install python2`

To Edit Python Scripts you can use GUI editors like [QuickEdit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rhmsoft.edit) or you can use terminal-based powerful editor [**VIM**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor))
